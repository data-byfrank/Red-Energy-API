# Red Energy API Data Manager

This project allows you to authenticate with the Red Energy API, fetch customer, property, and usage interval data, and store it in a local SQLite database. It is designed for automation and data analysis of your Red Energy usage. It should work for customers with multiple properties but I am not in lucky enough position to test this ðŸ˜‰.

## Features

- Fetches customer and property details from Red Energy.
- Downloads interval usage data for specified periods.
- Stores all data in a local SQLite database (`energy_data.db`).

## Prerequisites
- Python 3 and pip (pre-installed in the dev container)

# Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd "Red Energy API"
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Create .env file with the following info:
    - RE_USERNAME: Your Red Energy Username
    - RE_PASSWORD: Your Red Energy Password
    - RE_CLIENT_ID: You will need to use Proxyman on an IOS or Android device to capture traffic when using the red energy app to attain a client id. I am not sure if a client id has been issued for each user but its likely the client ids are generic across most mobile app installations. 
    - PRELOAD_USAGE_DAYS: Set this to the number of days you want to preload on first run. 
4. **Run main:**
   - For Python:
     ```sh
     python3 main.py
     ```

## Development

- Use the dev container for a pre-configured environment.
